What Advantages Does DIS Have?
==============================

-  Scalable: A DIS stream can seamlessly scale its data throughput from megabytes to terabytes per hour, and from thousands to millions of PUT records per second.
-  Easy to use: You can create a DIS stream within seconds. It is easy to put data into a stream, and build a data processing application.
-  Low cost: DIS has no upfront cost and you only pay for the resources you use.
-  Parallel processing: DIS allows you to have multiple DIS applications processing the same stream concurrently. For example, you can have one application running real-time analytics and another sending data to OBS from the same stream.
-  DIS preserves data for *N*\ \*24 hours, reducing the probability of data loss in case of application failures, individual machine failures, or facility failures. The value of *N* is an integer from 1 to 7.
