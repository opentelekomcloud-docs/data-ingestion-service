What Is a Partition?
====================

Partitions are the base throughput unit of a DIS stream. When creating a DIS stream, you are expected to specify the number of partitions needed within your stream.

By default, each tenant has 1 to 50 partitions. Tenants can configure the number of partitions as required.

To increase the quota, submit a service ticket. The upper limit is calculated based on the actual load of the cluster.
