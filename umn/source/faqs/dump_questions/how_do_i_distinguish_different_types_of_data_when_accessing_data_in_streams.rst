How Do I Distinguish Different Types of Data When Accessing Data in Streams?
============================================================================

-  By stream: Different types of data use different streams and can be distinguished by stream.
-  By partition: Different types of data use different partitions on one stream. Each partition is assigned one partition key. Different types of data can be distinguished by partition key of each partition.
