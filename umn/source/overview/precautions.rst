Precautions
===========

Read the following precautions before using DIS:

-  Recommended browser to access the DIS console

   -  Google Chrome: 48.0 or later

   -  Mozilla FireFox: 43.0 or later

   -  Internet Explorer: 9.0 or later

      If you cannot log in to the DIS console using Internet Explorer 9.0, run the browser as the Administrator user or re-install the browser as the Administrator user (by default, the Administrator user is disabled in certain Windows systems, such as Windows 7 Ultimate. That is, users other than the Administrator user are selected by default to install Internet Explorer.) Reinstall Internet Explorer 9.0 or later (recommended) or run Internet Explorer 9.0 as user **Administrator**.

-  Sensitive data must be encrypted using DIS SDK or another encryption tools before being put into DIS streams.
-  When a user uploads data using a DIS stream, the total size of records in a single request cannot exceed 5 MB.
